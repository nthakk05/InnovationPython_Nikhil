Write a program in Python to perform the following operation:

while True:
        a = "consultadd"
        b = "Python Training"
        c = "Consultadd - Python Training"
        x = float(input("Enter a Number: "))
        if x % 3 == 0 and x % 5 == 0:
            print(c)
        elif x % 3 == 0:
            print(a)
        elif x % 5 == 0:
            print(b)
        else:print("Number is not divisible by 3, 5 or Both")

Answer 2#

Write a program in Python to perform the following operator based task

print("""Enter 1 for Addition , 
Enter 2 for Subtraction, 
Enter 3 for Division, 
Enter 4 for Multiplication, 
Enter 5 for Average""")

a = int(input("Enter a value : "))
if a == 1:
    b = float(input("Enter First Number for addition: "))
    c = float(input("Enter Second Number for addition: "))
    d = b + c
    print(d)
elif a == 2:
    e = float(input("Enter First Number for Subtraction: "))
    f = float(input("Enter Second Number for Subtraction: "))
    g = e - f
    print(g)
elif a == 3:
    h = float(input("Enter First Number as numerator for Division: "))
    i = float(input("Enter Second Number for denominator Division: "))
    j = h / i
    print(j)
elif a == 4:
    k = float(input("Enter First Number for Multiplication: "))
    l = float(input("Enter Second Number for Multiplication: "))
    m = k * l
    print(m)
elif a == 5:
    numbers = input("Enter numbers separated by space ")
    numberList = numbers.split()
    sum1 = 0
    for num in numberList:
        sum1 += float(num)
    average = sum1 / len(numberList)
    print("Average of all entered numbers = ", average)
else:print("Please Enter a valid Selection")

Answer 3#
b = 20
c = 30
avg = (a +b +c)/3
print("avg = ", avg)
if (a > avg) and (b > avg) and  (c > avg):
    print("Average is higher than A, B, C")
elif (a > avg) and (b > avg):
    print("Average is higher than A, B")
elif (a > avg) and (c > avg):
    print("Average is higher than A, C")
elif (b > avg) and (c > avg):
    print("Average is higher than B, C")
elif (a > avg):
    print("Avg is just higher than a")
elif (b > avg):
    print("Avg is just higher than B")
elif (c > avg):
    print("Avg is just higher than C")

Answer 4 #
a = float(input("Enter a Value:  " ))
while True:
    if a > 0:
        print("Good Going")
        a = float(input("Enter a Value:  " ))
    elif a < 0:
        print("It's over")
        break
Answer 5#


print(*[i for i in range(2000, 3201) if not(i%7) and i%5])

Answer 6 #

2

Ans 3 Error because B in a break is capital 

Answer 7 #

for x in range(6):
    if (x == 3 or x==6):
        continue
    print(x,end=' ')

Answer 8 #
s = input('enter the combination: ')
wcount = 0
ncount = 0


ncount = sum(c.isdigit() for c in s)
wcount = sum(c.isalpha() for c in s)
print("number of letters in the string is", wcount)
print("number of digits in the string is ", ncount)
