Answer 8#

variables in Python can be reassigned to a new value that is a different data type from its current value. 
In fact, variables can be reassigned to any valid value in Python, regardless of its current value.
Variables are essentially like an empty box, that can contain something like a string, number, or other 
value. When you assign it a value, the box will contain that value, and when you reassign it, it will empty 
out the old value, and the new value will be placed inside of it.
